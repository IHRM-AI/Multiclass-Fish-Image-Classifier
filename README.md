# Multiclass-Fish-Image-Classifier
Developed a deep learning solution for multiclass fish image classification using CNN and transfer learning (VGG16, ResNet50, MobileNet, InceptionV3, EfficientNetB0). Performed preprocessing, augmentation, and model evaluation. Deployed best model via Streamlit for real-time predictions with confidence scores.
